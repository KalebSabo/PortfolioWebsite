        <p>
            This is a small side project I started a little less than a year ago, the idea is to create a Visual Novel with RPG elements.
            So far, the game has progressed in many different ways as my team and I have learned different techniques and ways to make the game more enjoyable.
            The code is developed using the Ren'Py engine and further Python coding to create the game mechanics.

            <u>Game Narrative:</u>
        </h2>
        <p>
            The game is called GRASP, the setting is in a post apocalyptic city rife with crime and corruption by both sinister politicians and the supernatural.
            The player will take on the role of deciding the fate of the city and its inhabitants. Below is the tentative narrative of the game.

        </h2>
        <p>
            We are currently working towards adding an adventure mode for the player to navigate through the city 
            with pixel sprites and recreating the turn based combat system to be more engaging and fun for the player.<br><br>
