                        Project 1 was an attempt at a visual novel RPG with friends, although it did not come to completion, it really showed me what it takes to make a game.<br>
                        <p class="inner-details">I lead the team of 4, dividing up the work among programming, writing, art, and music/sound design.<br>
                        It was a great learning experience and I am excited to continue making games in the future!

                        The game is still in development, but we have made a lot of progress and are excited to see where it goes.
                        To the left you will find our tentative game title and logo that was created by our awesome artist "ghoolly"<br>

                    <p class="inner-details">
                        The game is called GRASP, the setting is in a post apocalyptic city rife with crime and corruption by both sinister politicians and the supernatural.
                        The player will explore the city then ultimately deciding the fate of the city and its inhabitants.

                        We are currently working towards adding an adventure mode for the player to navigate through the city 
                        with pixel sprites and recreating the turn based combat system to be more engaging and fun for the player.<br><br>
