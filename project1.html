                        Project 1 is a visual novel that my friends and I started a little over a year ago. This allowed me the opportunity to flex my
                        muscles in Python Programming using the Ren'py game engine. I have posted much of the code that I created on my GitHub.

                        The game is still in development, but we have made a lot of progress and are excited to see where it goes.
                        Below you will find our tentative game title and logo that was created by our awesome artist "ghoolly"

                        The game is called GRASP, the setting is in a post apocalyptic city rife with crime and corruption by both sinister politicians and the supernatural.
                        The player will explore the city then ultimately deciding the fate of the city and its inhabitants.

                        We are currently working towards adding an adventure mode for the player to navigate through the city 
                        with pixel sprites and recreating the turn based combat system to be more engaging and fun for the player.<br><br>
