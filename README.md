Portfolio Showcase

Welcome to my personal portfolio website!
Here you’ll find a curated collection of projects I’ve built, ranging from game development to full-stack web applications. Each project represents countless hours of learning, experimentation, and problem-solving.

Featured Projects:

🕹️ Dark Willow Games
My indie game development studio focused on atmospheric, story-driven experiences built with the Godot Engine.
Features original titles, post-mortems, devlogs, and downloadable builds.

🖥️ SideViewTech – Tech Reviews & Tutorials
A modern tech review and tutorial platform with in-depth articles, performance benchmarks, and honest opinions on hardware, software, and developer tools. 

🎮 Godot Games (alias: ShadowedHands)
A showcase of smaller experimental games and prototypes made in Godot under my developer alias ShadowedHands. Includes 2D platformers, puzzle games, and gameplay mechanic experiments.

I’m a passionate full-stack developer and indie game creator with a love for clean code, performant systems, and immersive experiences. I work primarily with:
•  Godot (GDScript & C#)
•  JavaScript / CSS / HTML
•  Python
•  Clip Studio Paint
•  And various game engines & creative tools
When I’m not coding, you can find me designing levels, composing chiptune music, or writing tech deep-dives.
